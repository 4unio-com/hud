 * object to represents the actions that are available to the user
 * when that window and context are visible.  This acts as a set of
 * actions that can be activated by either the window manager changing
 * focus or the application changing contexts.
 *
 * On each action publisher there exits several action groups which can
 * be separated by allowing different prefixes for those action groups.
 * A particular prefix should only be used once per action publisher, but
 * an action group can by used by several action publishers.
 *
 * The values describing the action, including the label and description that
 * show up in the HUD are set via creating a #HudActionDescription for a
 * action.  Each action can have more than one description if there
 * is a reason to do so.  But, it is probably better to use the keywords
 * attribute in the majority cases.
