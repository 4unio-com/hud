hud (13.04.0daily13.02.20-0ubuntu2) raring; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Remove some Build-Depends that aren't in main yet and are used for the
      test suite.  We'll add tests back very soon as dep8 or without
      bustle.  This is just a brown-paper-bag release to fix component
      mismatch.
  * debian/hud-tools.install:
    - Don't ship hud-gtk stuff, since that's only built when tests are.
