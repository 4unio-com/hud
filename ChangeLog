	Implement the appstack.
	
	Here is how it works:
	* HudQuery no longer queries over all the sources, only over the current one (current_source). That Source is set on source creation to the current app and the user can change it with UpdateApp
	* HudQuery fills the appstack_model using list_applications that returns the application id+icon if the current search string matches the application the source represents
	* When the user calls UpdateApp, we do a "get" over all the sources to get which HudSource is responsible of that application_id.

	libhud: add some API
	
	We have (untested) HudOperation and HudAction API with implementation
	and a sketch for how the HudActionPublisher API could look.
	.
	
	Approved by PS Jenkins bot.

2012-12-07  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudActionPublisher: add GtkApplicationWindow support
	
	Automatically track added GtkApplicationWindow instances and notify the
	service of their "win" action groups.
	
	This only works for X11 so far but it will be very easy to extend it to
	other types of windows.

2012-12-07  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	demo: create an actual window
	
	Create an actual window and install the "blur" and "colourify" actions
	there (as they are already advertised as being there in the xml file).

2012-12-07  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	demo: port the gimp demo to GtkApplication

2012-12-07  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudActionPublisher: improve GApplication support
	
	When being created with an application, automatically publish the
	address of the "app" action group.

2012-12-07  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudActionPublisher: add public action group API
	
	Add a public API as a thin-wrapper around the HudManager API for
	publishing action groups.
	
	Ideally this API will disappear when we have a proper appmanager API.

2012-12-05  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudActionPublisher: add support for multiple publishers
	
	Each publisher must have an application ID specified -- either directly,
	or by way of giving a GApplication.
	
	The menu is now exported at a sensible path.
	
	We now also produce (theoretical) signals when creating
	HudActionPublisher to announce our presence to the service, including
	the object path of the menu.
	
	Update the demo program to the new API.

2012-12-05  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	add new HudManager file
	
	These (effectively) stub funcitons represent what will become the D-Bus
	interface for interaction with the HUD in lieu of the application
	manager.

2012-12-01  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudActionPublisher: start on implementing HudAux object
	
	Start implementing the HudAux object so that we can actually see the
	action descriptions from the bus.

2012-12-01  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudActionDescription: put name and target in attrs table
	
	Store the action name and target in the GHashTable of attributes.  This
	will make it easier to publish.

2012-12-01  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudActionPublisher: Fix some memory errors
	
	Mostly fixing leaks in the parser, but also a case of forgetting to take
	a reference.

2012-12-01  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Gtk and Valaify the consumer demo
	
	Start implementing GVTk (the GVariant toolkit) to convert GVariant
	descriptions of UI into UIs.
	
	We now construct a UI for the widgets from the demo (although the UI
	description is currently hardcoded).
	
	Actions are wired up.  It's now possible to do toggles and button
	clicks in the consumer and see the result in the demo app.  Sliders are
	not yet working.

2012-12-01  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	"f" is not a valid GVariant type string.  I meant "d".

2012-12-01  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	YoDawgIHeardYouLikeActionGroup: fix some refcounting issues
	
	_loop() already frees the variant, even though it didn't actually create
	it (because of the fake_mv business), so we still don't need to free it
	ourselves.
	
	Also, fix a small sed error.

2012-11-30  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Add gimp.xml to POTFILES.skip
	
	This certainly does not belong in HUD's gettext domain.

2012-11-30  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	YoDawgIHeardYouLikeActionGroup: properly free action records on finalize

2012-11-30  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	<ted> bzr commit -m "Oh, goodness"

2012-11-30  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	First pass at YoDawgIHeardYouLikeActionGroup
	
	Also, add a 'consumer' app to test it.  When invokved with the bus name
	of the 'gimp' demo app, it will start a colourify operation, change some
	parameters, apply it, then close it.
	
	It all seems to be working....

2012-11-30  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudAction: allow for NULL setup data
	
	If the remote didn't send a set of initial action values then don't
	crash by trying to set them anyway...

2012-11-30  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Make all the signals work, fix many bugs
	
	Finalise the signal story for HudOperation, meshing it up with the
	signal names from HudActionEntry.
	
	Connect all the signals properly.
	
	Fix some bugs in the GAction interface for activation and state
	reporting.
	
	HudAction is now more or less completely working.

2012-11-29  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	doc the public C API of HudOperation and HudAction
	
	Hide hud_operation_new() as a private API -- the only reason to get
	involved in operation creation is when subclassing and in this case you
	wouldn't call _new().

2012-11-29  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudOperation: add a user_data field
	
	The action callback handlers for the actions on the operation have (as
	by normal convention) the GActionMap on which they are installed (ie:
	the operation) as their user_data.
	
	They probably also want to know about the context on which the HudAction
	that created the action was installed (eg: the window or the
	application).
	
	Add a user_data field to store that and set it from the user_data given
	when installing the HudActionEntries.

2012-11-28  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Simplify storage of descriptions in publisher
	
	Lose the hashtable/sequence thing and replace it with a pure sequence,
	sorted by action identifier.
	
	Wire up the change signal on descriptions to emit signals on the
	publisher.

2012-11-28  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	doc the ActionPublisher (and ActionDescription)
	
	Rename a function while we're at it, for consistency.

2012-11-28  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Add an identifier to HudActionDescription
	
	This will allow simplifying the code in the publisher that tracks descriptions

2012-11-28  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Make HudActionDescription a proper GObject
	
	So it can fire a signal when it changes...

	HudOperation: prevent the remote from creating actions for us

2012-11-23  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Add a demo program to show how to do HudActions

2012-11-23  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Reword HudAction/Operation API to be a real action group
	
	This will allow us to view it from the HUD as an action group thus
	allowing widgets to interact with its state in the same way that they
	would with any actiongroup.

2012-11-16  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	HudToken and HudResult: fix up match highlighting
	
	Instead of returning (copies of) strings that we matched, keep track of
	the original strings and return them directly.  Then use pointer
	comparison to ensure we are highlighting exactly the correct segment.
	
	This avoids accidentally highlighting text that was part of markup
	escapes and also ensures that we are highlighting the correct instance
	of a string.

	hud: never allow perfect match for indicators
	
	The old scoring algorithm would assign a penalty of one for searching
	for "item" and finding "Item" (due to the case).  The new algorithm
	ignores case.
	
	This caused an unintended problem: the fact that we would never get
	perfect matches (due to the fact that nobody ever properly capitalised
	their search strings) was a good thing.  The indicator penalty is
	expressed as a percentage by which to increase whatever the distance
	already was, and that doesn't work well with the now-common case of a
	perfect match (since 0 + 50% is still 0).
	
	We tweak this situation by never allowing a match from an indicator have
	a perfect score.  If the indicator penalty is requested, then the
	distance must be at least 1.

	HudWindowSource: fix a couple of leaks
	
	- don't leak icon name while changing windows (fixes lp:972354)
	
	- don't leak the collector on finalize (which never happens)

2012-04-02  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Adjustments for Ted's review comments.

2012-04-02  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Increase the default swap penalty to 15
	
	The current value is too low.  It allows "xyze" as a valid match for "File" (3
	swapped characters at a cost of 10 each gives a total cost of 30, which is the
	maximum permitted value).
	
	It also causes an issue with accents.  Consider the case of typing
	"pref" and encountering the menu items "préférence" and "précédent".
	Clearly the user wants "préférence".  During normalisation, we convert
	each of these strings to "pre'fe'rence" and "pre'ce'dent".
	
	"pref" vs "pre'fe'rence" is best scored as the first "'" being dropped
	and the trailing "e'rence" also being dropped.  10 points for the accent
	drop plus 7 for the trailing "e'rence".  Total of 17 points.
	
	"pref" vs "pre'ce'dent" seems like it should be scored worse since the
	accent is dropped and the following character is incorrect.  Instead,
	however, the algorithm assigns a lower score for the possibility that
	the accent is replaced by the letter "f" (10 points) and then the rest
	of the characters "ce'dent" are dropped (7 points).  Also a total of 17
	points.
	
	This tie would be prevented with a higher swap cost.
	
	This problem could be fixed by special-casing the dropping of accents in
	the core search algorithm and I tested this approach but it had a
	substantial performance cost on the rather tight inner loop (nearly
	doubling the amount of time to do a search).
	
	Another possibility would be to drop all accents entirely during the
	normalisation process.  This sounds acceptable for French, but I imagine
	other languages may find this to be less than ideal.
	
	Also, consider "fl" against "file" and "fix" as another example that
	doesn't rely on accents to make its case (although the argument is
	somewhat weaker here).  This shows that we should probably just increase
	the swap cost.

2012-04-01  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Skip checking of search terms when it's not possible to take the term
	
	There are two situations in which a term will never be taken:
	
	- the max cost has already been exceeded
	
	- the cost of taking the term can't possibly beat the cost of dropping it
	
	In those two cases, don't do the extra work.

	- we now normalise to casefolded normal-form ucs4 ahead of time and
	operate on that instead of doing the normalisation at each search.
	This removes normalisation steps and utf8 operations from the main
	path of searching.
	
	- the innermost loop has been simplified free it of special-cases: it
	is now exactly equal to the reference implementation of Levenshtein
	distance from Wikipedia
	
	- we continue to support post-drops as a special-case, but other
	special cases have been removed.  pre-adds were probably a bad idea
	to start with, but it's worth talking about bringing back transposes.

	In the root-changed case, the DbusmenuClient drops the reference on the

	over our own (now-dead) copy of that item in order to remove it from our
	internal hashtable.
	
	Keep our own reference to it to ensure that this is safe.

	hud-service: delay dropping of query by 1 second
	
	Unity sends a 'CloseQuery' followed immediately by a 'StartQuery' on
	each keystroke in the search field.  This results in a bunch of extra
	dbusmenu messages being sent as the use count drops briefly to 0 only to
	go immediately back to 1.
	
	We can prevent that by delaying the destruction of the query.
	
	This decreases the number of dbus messages resulting from a short search
	by a factor of about 4 (on a number that measures in the 100s).

	distance: drop ignore_character() logic
	
	We currently had logic deep inside the hud's matching algorithm to
	ignore a set of characters: _(" _->")
	
	As it is, the characters ' ', '-' and '>' will never been seen by the
	algorithm because these characters are used as separators in the earlier
	tokenisation process.
	
	'_' is handled now by the HudItem code.  '_F' is turned into just 'F',
	for example.  The only way a '_' will end up at this point is if the
	application wanted a literal underscore (ie: they wrote '__' in the
	label) or if the user explicitly typed it as part of a search term.  In
	either of those cases, we should probably be treating it as a normal
	character anyway.
	
	That leaves the matter of the possibility that the translators could
	introduce additional characters here which, after discussing it, is
	probably not reasonable to support just for the sake of it.

	po/POTFILES.skip

2012-03-04  Charles Kerr  <charles.kerr@canonical.com>

	Don't mark hud.interface.c for translation.
	
	"make check" is failing in the po/ directory when it can't find hud.interface.c in the srcdir, so it fails if builddir != srcdir. This raises an interesting (to me, at least) question about how to get POTFILES.in to understand where to look for files generated from BUILT_SOURCES. However, there is a shorter path to solving this ticket: since nothing in hud.interface.c needs translation, removing it from POTFILES.in fixes "make check".

	Moving menu_prop_changed back to it's old location and adding a prototype to reduce the size of the diff

2011-02-03  Chris Coulson  <chrisccoulson@ubuntu.com>

	Fix LP: #706941 - unity-panel-service crashed with SIGSEGV in g_type_check_instance_cast()
	A menu item will continue to live if it is removed from it's parent whilst it is waiting
	for updated properties from the server. In this case, it is possible to get a property-changed
	signal from a menu item after already having received a child-removed signal from its parent,
	by which time the resources associated with that menu item have already been free'd. Handle
	this by ensuring we disconnect from the property-changed signal when receiving a child-removed
	signal.
	
	Also fix a couple of other bugs:
	- Ensure we keep a reference to a menuitem whilst waiting for it's first child to be realized
	- Fix menu_entry_removed to handle the case where a menu item hasn't been realized yet (and
	there is no WMEntry for it)
	- Don't leak all the IndicatorObjectEntry's when the root node changes. Calling
	menu_entry_removed from root_changed had no effect, so we provide a new helper for
	doing this
